# CHANGELOG

## 2026-06-05
- ops: ANTI_FABRICATION_GATE_ENABLED=1 in production (hard-case identity → force review)
- ops: SELF_CONSISTENCY_GATE_ENABLED=1 in production (N=2 hash mismatch → force review)
- decision: PII history = INTERNAL-ONLY FOREVER (repo private, topic closed)
- decision: SMART_NORMALIZE = DO_NOT_ENABLE (dictionaries don't fix model reading)
- decision: OneBrain/decideField = PARKED (revisit at GT≥50 different people)

## 2026-06-04
- feat: PR #81 merged — anti-fab canary turnkey, ADR-016, military registry, patronymic fix

- ops: DOCUMENT_CLASS_METRICS_ENABLED=1 in production
- GT: 6/30 VERIFIED_BY_OWNER (birth_cert x2, passport, i94, ead, military)
- accuracy: hard-case 25%, printed ~100%, false_negative_review=0 in mode C

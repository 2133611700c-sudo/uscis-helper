# CHANGELOG

## 2026-06-05 (post-runtime re-verification, agent — raw evidence)
- verify: review-gate fix NOW IN PROD — PR #84 merged; origin/main=2d2a391; e298d97 ancestor of main; healthz sha=2d2a391==main. (Was feat-only/not-deployed in the prior entry.)
- verify: independent re-run of the fix — tsc 0 errors; full suite **2859 passed / 4 skipped** (exact match to claim); reviewGate.ts server block + generate-pdf wiring + TranslateWizard client block + new tests all read and correct.
- verify (runtime logs): real prod extractions ran ~01:01–01:03 — 3× POST /api/translation/vision-extract 200 each emitting `[document_class_metric]`, + 2× POST /api/tps/ocr/extract 200; **0 error/fatal in 3h**. → DOCUMENT_CLASS_METRICS = RUNTIME VERIFIED; deployed safety code = no regression.
- GAP (unchanged): env flag VALUES not readable (no Vercel env-list MCP tool) → owner `vercel env ls production`. Anti-fab/self-consistency FIRING not independently confirmable (gates emit no log; metric line truncated; owner's "8/10 review=true" is owner-observed). To prove the gate: capture one hard-case extraction RESPONSE, not logs.
- no code change; no flag touched; no PII upload performed by agent.

## 2026-06-05 (translation public wizard hardening — local runtime verified, agent)
- fix: closed the real public Translation Wizard false-readiness gap in the legacy contour:
  unresolved OCR `review_required` fields now block payment and final PDF download, and
  `/api/translation/generate-pdf` now rejects unresolved OCR review fields from the wizard payload.
- ux: added an explicit `Confirm` action for unchanged OCR-flagged values, so a user can
  human-confirm a correct value without faking an edit; editing or confirming clears the
  local review flag and re-enables the payment path only when all flagged fields are resolved.
- verify: `pnpm --filter web exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false` PASS; `pnpm --filter web test` PASS;
  `pnpm --filter web run build` PASS.
- live local proof on `/en/services/translate-document/start` with real booklet fixture:
  `reviewBadgesBefore=4`, `confirmButtonsBefore=4`, `payDisabledBefore=true`,
  then after explicit confirms `reviewBadgesAfter=0`, `confirmButtonsAfter=0`,
  `payDisabledAfter=false`.
- evidence: `docs/reports/TRANSLATION_REVIEW_HARDENING_2026-06-04.md`
- truth boundary: production still needs one post-deploy reverify for this exact fix.

## 2026-06-04 (target recognition scheme verification, agent)
- verify (read-only): added `docs/reports/TARGET_RECOGNITION_SCHEME_FILE_VERIFICATION_2026-06-04.md`
  to reconcile the requested D0..D6 + Auditor recognition scheme against the actual repository file-by-file.
- confirmed: the scheme exists as architecture docs and as parked `engine/*` + `central-brain/*` code.
- confirmed: the live default product spine is still `docintel/documentFieldReader.ts` + Gemini provider + canonical arbitration, not `consensus.ts` multi-reader control.
- confirmed: D0 preprocess is real; D1 Gemini reader is live; D2 KMU-55 is live; gazetteer/patronymic exist but are not universally active by default; review/PDF/audit pieces exist but are split.
- verdict: repo contains most target building blocks, but the project does NOT yet match the exact target scheme in live runtime. No behavior change; no flag change; no prod mutation.

## 2026-06-04 (latest audit / inventory reconciliation, agent)
- verify (read-only): added `docs/reports/LATEST_AUDIT_INVENTORY_RECONCILIATION_2026-06-04.md`
  to check the newest inventory / audit / matrix / verdict reports against current code.
- confirmed: the freshest truth-layer reports are mostly internally consistent and align with code:
  live spine = `readDocument()` + Gemini provider + arbitration/gates.
- confirmed: older snapshot reports are now partially stale; specifically, reports claiming `ua_military_id`
  absent are outdated because `docintel/documentRegistry.ts` now defines `ua_military_id`.
- clarified: `ROUTE_INVENTORY_2026-05-29.md` remains valid for payment/review-bypass risk, but it does not
  answer the newer "which brain is live" architecture question.
- no behavior change; no test run; no prod mutation.

## 2026-06-04 (critical live-door re-verify, agent)
- verify (read-only): added `docs/reports/CRITICAL_REVERIFY_LIVE_DOOR_2026-06-04.md`
  to correct earlier over-broad claims about what is "not wired" vs "wired behind flags".
- confirmed against code:
  - `snapCity`, patronymic reconcile, authority resolve are already wired into the live `readDocument()` path
  - anti-fabrication and self-consistency are already wired into `readDocument()`
  - `garbageGuard` is runtime-used in UI/review layers, but not server-side in the live reader
- corrected truth: several D2 / verification pieces are present in the live door already; the accurate
  distinction is default-OFF flag-gated behavior versus absent behavior. No behavior change; no prod mutation.

## 2026-06-04 (project understanding master, agent)
- verify (read-only): added `docs/reports/PROJECT_UNDERSTANDING_MASTER_2026-06-04.md`
  after a full-project understanding pass across startup docs, accepted ADRs, repo structure, `lib/*`, and
  product OCR routes.
- confirmed: the repo is best understood as three coexisting architecture layers:
  legacy TPS/product-specific OCR, current shared `docintel` + `canonical/core` live spine, and parked/target
  `central-brain` + `engine/consensus` direction.
- clarified: TPS merge brain (`lib/tps/centralBrain.ts`) is a separate live plane, not dead code.
- no behavior change; no test run; no prod mutation.

## 2026-06-05 (UX review chain — CODE-VERIFIED, agent)
- verify (read-only, Translation flagship): the review→correct→PDF safety chain is wired correctly in code:
  (a) `EvidenceReviewPage.tsx` surfaces review — "Needs review" label + ⚠ + "verify the value is correct",
  driven by `field.is_critical && field.review_required`; (b) `correct-field` route records a `user_corrections`
  row + updates `normalized_value` (user can fix); (c) `generate-pdf` route RETURNS `review_required` gate →
  **PDF is blocked while review is pending** (uncertain fields never flow silently into the PDF); (d) `render`
  route enforces "Final PDF fields must match the confirmed DB values" with a PII-safe source-to-final audit.
- So the gate→review_required→UI→PDF-block→confirmed-value chain is connected STRUCTURALLY. Still NOT proven in
  live runtime (no extraction processed). Roadmap Wave B updated to "code-verified, runtime pending".
- re-confirmed infra: healthz sha=73e7505 == main, ok @ 00:48; no new errors. No code change; no flag touched; no PII upload.

## 2026-06-05 (post-deploy verification, agent — raw evidence)
- verify: prod healthz sha=73e7505 == origin/main HEAD; PRs #80/#81/#82 MERGED; latest prod deploy dpl_7GbX READY. Code live.
- verify: 0 error/fatal runtime logs in 3h; 6h prod traffic = only /api/healthz 200 + /robots.txt. No regression.
- GAP: document_class_metric logs in 24h = 0 → no real extraction in prod → anti-fab/self-consistency runtime effect UNOBSERVED (gates emit no log; only visible in a real extraction response).
- GAP: flag env VALUES not independently readable via Vercel MCP (no env-list tool) — "ON" rests on owner action + code presence. Owner to confirm `vercel env ls production`.
- GAP: STATUS accuracy line overstated (US printed ~100% is raw API not product accuracy; UA printed 60-83% not what measured runs show). Flagged in STATUS POST-DEPLOY VERIFICATION block.
- verdict: DEGRADED (not broken) — infra green, safety-active claim unproven until one controlled hard-case extraction runs in prod. No code change; no flag touched; no PII upload performed.

## 2026-06-05
- ops: ANTI_FABRICATION_GATE_ENABLED=1 in production (hard-case identity → force review)
- ops: SELF_CONSISTENCY_GATE_ENABLED=1 in production (N=2 hash mismatch → force review)
- decision: PII history = INTERNAL-ONLY FOREVER (repo private, topic closed)
- decision: SMART_NORMALIZE = DO_NOT_ENABLE (dictionaries don't fix model reading)
- decision: OneBrain/decideField = PARKED (revisit at GT≥50 different people)

## 2026-06-04
- feat: PR #81 merged — anti-fab canary turnkey, ADR-016, military registry, patronymic fix
- feat: PR #80 merged — P2 dictionaries, anti-fab gate, self-consistency, class metric, GT workflow
- ops: DOCUMENT_CLASS_METRICS_ENABLED=1 in production
- GT: 6/30 VERIFIED_BY_OWNER (birth_cert x2, passport, i94, ead, military)
- accuracy: hard-case 25%, printed ~100%, false_negative_review=0 in mode C

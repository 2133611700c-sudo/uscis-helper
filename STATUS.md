# STATUS — Messenginfo TPS Robot
**Updated:** 2026-05-26 Session 19 — Playwright E2E + ZIP/PDF proof + audit wiring landed locally, remote DB migrations applied
**Status:** DEGRADED
**Live SHA:** `71ef1731aac9539c68e3fa072a656e368c02cff9` (verified via `/api/tps/health` on 2026-05-26)

## Session 19 Truth (no fake pass)
- `VERIFIED` browser E2E against production URL (`/en/services/tps-ukraine/start`) passes with real upload→OCR→review→generate flow.
- `VERIFIED` ZIP artifact is real (`apps/web/test-results/booklet-review-artifacts/tps-packet.zip`, ~2.58MB).
- `VERIFIED` PDF readback finds core values in generated PDFs:
  - `Kuropiatnyk`, `FU262473`, `UHP`, `Los Angeles`, `90029`.
- `VERIFIED` live Supabase `tps_ocr_audit` is actively receiving fresh rows (checked in Supabase UI and via linked SQL).
- `VERIFIED` remote DB migrations are now synced through `20260526000001`.

## Why status is still DEGRADED
- `UNVERIFIED ON LIVE SHA`: new `brain_raw` audit payload wiring is local code only until deploy of new app SHA.
- Current live rows still show old audit format:
  - `brain_raw IS NOT NULL = false` on latest rows
  - `rejected_fields` currently stored as JSON string scalar on live rows.
- `UNVERIFIED`: city/province/patronymic booklet values were not auto-surfaced in this specific production E2E run (`extraction flags: city=false, province=false, middle=false`), so no claim of stable auto-fill is made.

**Updated:** 2026-05-25 Session 18 — booklet drift killed (3 legs) + drift gate v2 + evidence report + zero-trust re-audit
**Live SHA:** e1429ba (or drift gate v2 commit pending push). Prod verified at simulation level.
**Tests:** 1985/1985
**Commits this session:** 5 (`794b86d` client fix, `8bce911` drift gate v1, `249a5b4` evidence report, `e1429ba` formulation correction, drift gate v2 pending push)

## EVIDENCE REPORT (corrected after external review)
`reports/BOOKLET_PIPELINE_EVIDENCE_REPORT_20260525.md` — 28-run analysis with three-class evidence rule (officially claimed / verified on our data / not verified). Headline findings:
- `dob`: brain emits unparseable format in 28/28 runs (`validated_skipped: "date not parseable"`). Brain prompt says to convert Ukrainian-month genitive forms but emission evidently retains trailing words like `року`. Fixable on this stack; not yet fixed.
- `given_name`: raw OCR garbage on N=1 booklet sample (`"Behri"` from Cyrillic `В` misread as Latin `B`). Vision and DocAI both fail. **NOT proven to fail across the population or across providers.** Azure Read claims expanded Russian handwriting support (officially); we have not benchmarked it. Image preprocessing and region cropping have not been tried. Honest current default: manual entry until multi-sample data says otherwise.
- All other "missing" booklet fields are forbidden by design (passport MRZ is authoritative for those).

## SESSION 18 — booklet family_name actually reaches the user

### Post-mortem on Session 17
Session 17 closed with "production verified, surname=Kuropiatnyk, crossref_ok" against the OCR API. That measurement was correct at the API boundary and misleading at the user boundary. The server contract (commit `ce12446`) allowed `family_name`. The client throws it away in **three** independent places that the predecessor had not updated:
1. `BOOKLET_WAVE1_FIELDS` (line ~1121) — wave1 set was still 3 fields, missing `family_name`.
2. `SLOT_ALLOWED_FIELDS.booklet` (line ~1082) — entire `booklet` entry was missing, so any post-hydration session stripped the field.
3. `ExtractionSource` / `SourceType` unions — `'dual_ocr_crossref'` was emitted by the server but absent from the client/arbiter type narrowing, silently downgrading the source to `ocr_visual` (lower priority).

Net effect on prod (still live on b29ef3f as of now): booklet-only TPS users see 3 fields in Step 5 review; surname comes through manual entry only. The "10/10" stability report measured the API response, not user experience.

### Fix shipped this session
- `TPSWizardV2.tsx`: add `family_name` to `BOOKLET_WAVE1_FIELDS`, add `booklet` entry to `SLOT_ALLOWED_FIELDS`, extend `ExtractionSource` union with `'dual_ocr_crossref'`, accept it in source-type narrowing.
- `fieldArbiter.ts`: extend `SourceType` union with `'dual_ocr_crossref'` so server-emitted source survives the wire.
- `scripts/wizard-simulation-test.mjs`: regression script that mirrors the client filter and asserts 4 fields on the canonical sample (added).
- Diff is 17 lines of code. Typecheck clean. 1985/1985 tests pass.

### What this fix is NOT
- It is not an end-to-end browser proof. The `wizard-simulation-test.mjs` script mirrors the wave1 set as a hardcoded constant; it does not actually load `BOOKLET_WAVE1_FIELDS` from the .tsx at runtime. So the next drift between server and client is **not yet** caught in CI.
- It does not solve the structural problem: 4 places (server contract + 3 client filters) maintained by hand, comments saying "mirrors server".
- It does not address `given_name` or `dob` from booklet — those are still forbidden by the server contract, awaiting multi-sample benchmark.

## STRUCTURAL DEBT — booklet allowed-fields drift surface
Server (`documentContracts.ts:106`) + 3 client filters in `TPSWizardV2.tsx` (1082, 1121, 1973) + 1 arbiter union in `fieldArbiter.ts:91` = **5 sync points**.

**Drift gate now wired into CI** (`guards.yml` → `scripts/check-booklet-contract-drift.mjs`): parses the three set literals out of source at build time and fails the workflow if they drift. This catches the Session-17 bug pattern. Not a structural fix — comments still say "mirrors server" — but it eliminates the silent-drift failure mode.

Long-term fix still queued: server emits the contract over `/api/tps/contract/booklet`, client fetches once and uses for all 3 filters. After that the gate collapses to a typecheck.

## NEXT STEP
1. ✅ Pushed (794b86d) and verified on prod via simulation script.
2. ✅ Drift gate `scripts/check-booklet-contract-drift.mjs` wired into `guards.yml`.
3. Browser-level E2E (Playwright + PDF byte-grep) — still owed. Simulation script is not a substitute.
4. Refactor: server emits `/api/tps/contract/:slot`, client fetches once, deprecate the hand-maintained client constants. Then the drift gate collapses to a typecheck.
5. Multi-sample booklet benchmark (still the real Phase 0 gap from the Central Brain plan).
6. Open product question: relax server contract to allow `given_name` + `dob` from booklet — only after multi-sample benchmark proves crossref handles them.

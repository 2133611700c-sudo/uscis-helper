## Notes

- Old `RESEND_API_KEY` (set ~2h prior by previous agent) was removed and replaced with the new messenginfo-scoped key.
- `BACKUP_EMAIL` env var (set 2h prior) was left as-is — not part of contact email flow.
- handyandfriend.com Resend account (`2133611700c@gmail.com`) was **not touched**.
- Free plan limit: 1 domain per account — separate accounts are required by design.

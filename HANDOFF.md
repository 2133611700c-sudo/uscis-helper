# HANDOFF — Session 74 (2026-05-30)

## Session 74 — Full recognition-engine inventory (branch `docs/recognition-inventory`, off main)

Exhaustive inventory of every recognition engine/brain/provider across all products (3 parallel code scans). Confirms the two-stack reality behind the owner-reported two-brain bug: Stack A (Translation) = Gemini-docintel + engine/orchestrator + central-brain; Stack B (TPS + Re-Parole) = Google Vision + keyword modules + tps/centralBrain (own dictionaryBridge/guard/arbiter). The most capable engine (engine/orchestrator) is NOT wired to TPS. Geography/authority/transliteration are normalized two different ways. Dead: engine/assembler, knowledge/normalize.ts. EAD = manual, no OCR. Document: `docs/architecture/RECOGNITION_ENGINES_FULL_INVENTORY.md`. Drives ADR-016 (#44) unification (B1–B5).

# HANDOFF — Session 71 (2026-05-30)

## Session 71 — Booklet orientation auto-rotate (branch `fix/booklet-orientation`, off main)

The TPS OCR route already rotated 90/180/270 for an international passport whose MRZ was not found, accepting a rotation only if it located an MRZ. An INTERNAL passport booklet has NO MRZ, so rotation never helped it — a rotated booklet matched on garbage and was never re-tried. Extended ADDITIVELY: (1) trigger rotation also when a booklet matched with <2 identity fields; (2) in the rotation loop, track the rotation with the most identity fields (`bookletFieldCount`); (3) after the loop, adopt that rotation if it has strictly more identity fields than the upright read. The passport MRZ path is unchanged (handled first). tsc 0; TPS 370 pass; full web pass; content-guard 0.

**Honest caveat:** cannot verify with a live rotated-booklet image in this env (no upload). The change is additive and only adopts a strictly-better rotation, so it cannot regress the upright/passport paths. Owner should live-repro a rotated booklet to confirm the chosen rotation reads correctly.

**Remaining:** P2–P5 glossary; owner-gated (birth visual approval, official military/diploma/pension URLs + КАТОТТГ byte-verify).
# HANDOFF — Session 70 (2026-05-30)

## Session 70 — Owner mode site-wide (branch `feat/owner-mode-site-wide`, off main)

Closed the owner request: test every product without payment. Inventory: TPS wizard already had owner-bypass; EAD + Re-Parole have no site payment (free); server routes (generate-pdf/render/tps-packet) already honour `isOwnerSession`; owner-login UI exists at `/[locale]/owner` (request-code → verify-code). The ONLY gap was the Translation wizard — it had no owner check and forced Stripe. Fixed: it now fetches `/api/owner/status` on mount, and `handlePayment` skips Stripe → `setScreen(7)` for the owner (the generate-pdf route already bypasses the payment gate for a verified owner cookie). CTA shows "Owner — continue free". `ownerMode.test.ts` 3/3; full web pass; tsc 0; content-guard 0.

**Remaining (honest):** orientation auto-rotate (needs a live rotated fixture to verify — owner to provide or accept blind); P2–P5 glossary consolidation; owner-gated (birth visual approval, official military/diploma/pension URLs + КАТОТТГ byte-verify).

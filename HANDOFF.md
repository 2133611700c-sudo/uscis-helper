# HANDOFF — Session 71 (2026-05-30)

## Session 71 — Booklet orientation auto-rotate (branch `fix/booklet-orientation`, off main)

The TPS OCR route already rotated 90/180/270 for an international passport whose MRZ was not found, accepting a rotation only if it located an MRZ. An INTERNAL passport booklet has NO MRZ, so rotation never helped it — a rotated booklet matched on garbage and was never re-tried. Extended ADDITIVELY: (1) trigger rotation also when a booklet matched with <2 identity fields; (2) in the rotation loop, track the rotation with the most identity fields (`bookletFieldCount`); (3) after the loop, adopt that rotation if it has strictly more identity fields than the upright read. The passport MRZ path is unchanged (handled first). tsc 0; TPS 370 pass; full web pass; content-guard 0.

**Honest caveat:** cannot verify with a live rotated-booklet image in this env (no upload). The change is additive and only adopts a strictly-better rotation, so it cannot regress the upright/passport paths. Owner should live-repro a rotated booklet to confirm the chosen rotation reads correctly.

**Remaining:** P2–P5 glossary; owner-gated (birth visual approval, official military/diploma/pension URLs + КАТОТТГ byte-verify).

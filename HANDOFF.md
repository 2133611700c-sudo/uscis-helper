# HANDOFF — Session 70 (2026-05-30)

## Session 70 — Owner mode site-wide (branch `feat/owner-mode-site-wide`, off main)

Closed the owner request: test every product without payment. Inventory: TPS wizard already had owner-bypass; EAD + Re-Parole have no site payment (free); server routes (generate-pdf/render/tps-packet) already honour `isOwnerSession`; owner-login UI exists at `/[locale]/owner` (request-code → verify-code). The ONLY gap was the Translation wizard — it had no owner check and forced Stripe. Fixed: it now fetches `/api/owner/status` on mount, and `handlePayment` skips Stripe → `setScreen(7)` for the owner (the generate-pdf route already bypasses the payment gate for a verified owner cookie). CTA shows "Owner — continue free". `ownerMode.test.ts` 3/3; full web pass; tsc 0; content-guard 0.

**Remaining (honest):** orientation auto-rotate (needs a live rotated fixture to verify — owner to provide or accept blind); P2–P5 glossary consolidation; owner-gated (birth visual approval, official military/diploma/pension URLs + КАТОТТГ byte-verify).
